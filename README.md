# CVIP_Edge_Detection

## Problem 1: Edge Detection

Application	of	Sobel	filter	in	x	axis	y	axis	and	taking	squared	average	of	both	
(a)	Obtain	and	display	the	DoG	image	by	applying	the	following	DoG	mask	to	the	test	image
(b)Compute	and	display	the	zero-crossing	of	the	DoG	image	obtained	in	(a)	
(c)	Compute	and	display	the	zero-crossing	strong	edges	by	removing	weak	edges	that	do	not	have	first	derivative	support	in	(b)
(d)	Compute	and	display	the	LoG	zero-crossing	edges	by	applying	the	following	LoG	mask	to	the	test	image
(e)	Compare	the	results	in	(c)	and	(d)	and	explain	why	the	edges	obtained	in	(c)	and	(d)	are	different		

## Problem	2: Region	merging

Region	merging	is	an	effective	scheme	for	region	growing	based	segmentation.	Region	growing	may	begin	with	each	pixel	within	an	image	in	which	a	pixel	represents	a	single	region	initially.	Regions	will	be	merged	to	satisfy	the	region	segmentation	using the crack image technique and finding the weak and strong edges to a region. Eventually expanding the region iteratively.	Perform	the	following	algorithm	to	the	“Mixed	Vegetables”	test	image	through	Python	programming:	(a)	Perform	Algorithm	6.18	–	Region	merging	via	boundary	melting	and	display	the	results	of	the	final	region	merging.
